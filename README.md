# 🎥 TabCaster – Stream Your Browser Tabs to NDI

**TabCaster** transforms any Chromium-based browser tab (Chrome, Edge, or Brave) into a real-time **NDI® source**, allowing seamless integration of web content into professional video workflows — without traditional screen capture or encoding overhead.

> ⚡️ Zero capture. Zero latency. Just pure pixels.

---

## 🌍 Overview

TabCaster bridges your browser and the **NDI 6 SDK**, streaming frames directly from your tab to NDI-compatible apps such as **OBS Studio**, **vMix**, **NDI Studio Monitor**, or **TriCaster**.

It captures frames straight from the browser compositor using `OffscreenCanvas`, bypassing the CPU-heavy screen-capture path.  
The frames are then transmitted to a lightweight native host (built in C++ with the NDI SDK), which broadcasts them as an NDI source on your local network.
